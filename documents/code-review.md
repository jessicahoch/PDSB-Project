The final code review is due on May 11th. Please wait until at least May 6th to complete the code review so that the projects are more developed. Create a markdown document and save it as documents/code-review.md. In this file write short answers to the following questions. Choose three projects from the links listed below to review when answering these questions:

    In reviewing your peer's projects did you find that their README files made it clear what their project is, how to install it, and how to use it? Do you think that your README file does a good job at this?

    Did your peer have Python scripts in a directory named project, and were you able to understand the structure of the python scripts?

    Did your peer provide example notebooks in the notebooks directory? Does the README file link to, or tell you about the example notebooks? Were you able to understand from the example notebooks how to use the code, or what your peer is trying to solve in the notebook?

    Did you come up with any ideas for improving your own project by reviewing your peer's project directories?
