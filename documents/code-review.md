I chose the projects created by the following peers to review: Anika Petach, Alex Procton, Chloe Hacker

### In reviewing your peer's projects did you find that their README files made it clear what their project is, how to install it, and how to use it? Do you think that your README file does a good job at this?

Both Anika and Alex wrote concise and informative README files describing what their project is about, outlining download instructions, and directing the user to example notebooks. In Alex's case, he also provided information on how to download supplementary tools, specifically igraph. Chloe's project had a different format, as she provides example notebooks of analyzing city ridership data in conjunction with events. The README file is also clear about the purpose of her project and the content of each notebook. 

### Did your peer have Python scripts in a directory named project, and were you able to understand the structure of the python scripts?

No, everyone stored their code in example notebooks. Everyone was clear in their README files that the python scripts were stored in a notebook. 

### Did your peer provide example notebooks in the notebooks directory? Does the README file link to, or tell you about the example notebooks? Were you able to understand from the example notebooks how to use the code, or what your peer is trying to solve in the notebook?

Yes, everyone provided example notebooks in the directory. The README file specifies that examples can be found in the notebooks. Yes, in everyone's case, I was able to understand what was being done. 

### Did you come up with any ideas for improving your own project by reviewing your peer's project directories?

I've been interested in geographically visualizing my data, potentially with proportional symbols denoting fungal diversity or abundance. I could use Chloe's mapping tutorial, which employs plotly maps, to visualize my data in this way.
