## PDSB Project Proposal

*The problem* 

Currently, I am completing a project which aims to characterize plant root-associated fungal communities on green roofs in NYC. It will identify patterns of soil fungal community composition and diversity based on vegetation community and a suite of abiotic variables. Since we are linking green roof biotic composition, I will also analyze the data by guild. 
  
*The data*

For this project, I will use a table of fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs) generated from ITS sequence data. Soil samples were collected during July 2017 in NYC on 30 green roof systems and there are 9 random samples per roof. Laboratory and bioinformatics work was carried out by collaborators at the University of Oregon and UC Berkeley. 

*The tools*

Python (pandas, skbio), R (FUNGuild) 

*The novelty* 

This method will streamline data organization, statistics (Bray-Curtis similarity/ANOSIM), and data visualization (NMDS plots, relative abundance figures) for fungal taxonomic data.  

*The goal* 

Produce an Python library documenting this workflow (OTU table transformation, difference matrix, statistics, visualization), and figures
